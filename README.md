# Personal-Homepage
This is a [hyperlink](https://github.com/stefanogrillo/CS50-s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-2021-2022/tree/main/pset8/homepage) to a CS50 exercise where I managed to create my personal homepage without the use of external libraries First HTML project (except for some logos with Bootstrap).


The website has a <i>responsive nature</i> and is inspired by <b>Apple's webpage</b>: colorful, bright, plenty of pictures and links.<br>
The <i>navbar is sticky</i> to the top of the page, then it transforms to a <i>dropdown menu</i> when the screen size is too small.<br>
There are <i>5 total branches</i> (included the index-homepage) and some <i>hyperlinks</i> to other personal accounts (email, GitHub...).<br>
The <i>CSS</i> file is created on purpose and uses also <i>Bootstrap</i> features for the personal account logos.


The <i>Index</i> includes different colored sections to highlight each branch of the homepage. <i>Home</i>, <i>Bio</i>, <i>Curriculum</i>, <i>Projects</i> and <i>Contacts</i> are cool in the <i>Navbar</i>, but needed the spotlight. So, <i>Bio</i> has a dedicated <i>section</i> (<i>white background</i>), along with <i>Contacts</i>. The <i>second section</i> (<i>yellow background</i>) has an hyperlink to the <i>Curriculum page</i>. The <i>third section</i> (<i>ciano background</i>) highlights the <i>Projects</i> done at the moment when I finished this project.<br>

The <i>Bio section</i> hihlights basic information about me and my achievements, divided by sections by <i>Color</i>: personal data and personal achievements. The images should inspire my cultural background.

The <i>Curriculum section</i> deep dives into the experiences and achievements i had so far. I used Tables and Colors to define different sections, making the overall structure well divided.

The <i>Project section</i> is simple, to highlights my current projects done.
