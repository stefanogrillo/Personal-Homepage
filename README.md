# Personal-Homepage
This is a [hyperlink](https://github.com/stefanogrillo/CS50-s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-2021-2022/tree/main/pset8/homepage) to a CS50 exercise where I managed to create my personal homepage. First HTML project ever, with no Bootstrap (except for some logos). Improvable, but still...

The website has a <i>responsive nature</i> and is inspired by <b>Apple's webpage</b>: colorful, bright, plenty of pictures and links.<br>
The <i>navbar is sticky</i> to the top of the page, then it transforms to a <i>dropdown menu</i> when the screen size is too small.<br>
There are <i>5 total branches</i> (included the index-homepage) and some <i>hyperlinks</i> to other personal accounts (email, GitHub...).<br>
The <i>CSS</i> file is created on purpose and uses also <i>Bootstrap</i> features for the personal account logos.<br>

The Index includes different colored sections to highlight each branch of the homepage. Home, Bio, Curriculum, Projects and Contacts are cool in the Navbar, but Bio needed an highlight in the first section, with the Contacts. In the second section I inserted an hyperlink to the Curriculum page. The last section highlights the Projects done at the moment when I finished this project.<br>

The Bio section hihlights the basic information about me and my achievements. The images should inspire my cultural background.
