# Personal-Homepage
This is a [hyperlink](https://github.com/stefanogrillo/CS50-s-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-2021-2022/tree/main/pset8/homepage) to a CS50 exercise where I managed to create my personal homepage.
The website has a responsive nature and is inspired by Apple's webpages: colorful, bright, plenty of pictures and links. The navbar is sticky to the top of the page, then it transforms to a dropdown menu when the screen size is too small. There are 5 total branches (included the index-homepage) and some hyperlinks to other personal accounts (email, GitHub...). Of course it is improvable, but still, I did this without experience. Hope you can see my potential more than my errors.
